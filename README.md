### Tech

WWWBS uses the following technologies and open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [Breakdance](http://breakdance.io) - HTML to Markdown converter
* [MySQL] - for database access
* [PHP] - duh

### Installation (hi CMPT370 TAs!)

WWWBS requires [PHP] to run.

Installation is easy. Just copy the "Wacky Waving Wellness Booking System" folder in your htdocs file. Boom. Wacky.
